.babelrc:
  babel is a transpiler, it converts modern JS down to ES5 so older browsers understand it.
  presets:
    Set of plugins used to support particular language features.
    They are run in the reverse order they are listed.
    On installation the presets are prefixed with 'babel-preset-' but the name in .babelrc does not include the prefix.
    env:
      Same as 'latest', (or es2015, es2016, and es2017 together)
    react:
      Adds support for JSX.
  plugins:
    Apply transformations to the code.
    The run in the order they are listed.
    On installation the presets are prefixed with 'babel-plugin-' but the name in .babelrc does not include the prefix.
    transform-class-properties:
      Avoids the need of having a constructor and variables can be defined as class variables.
    transform-object-rest-spread:
      Enables to use the spread operator on objects (...myObject).

Object spreading:
  An attribute of an object listed before the object is spread will not be modified, since the object
  spread will override the attribute. In order to modify the object's attribute the modified value must
  go after the object spread:
    Incorrect:
      myObjectAttribute: 'newValue', ...myObject
    Correct:
      ...myObject, myObjectAttribute: 'newValue'

Inline default function exports:
  Incorrect:
    export default functionName = () => {}  // then
    import functionName from 'myPath';
  Correct:
    export default () => {}                 // then
    import myFunction from 'myPath';

react-redux:
  Enables to connect redux to react components.
  Uses heavily "higher order components".

jest:
  Testing library
  https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/api.html
  Testing in watch mode:
    In package.json:
      "scripts": {"test": "jest --watch"}
    From command line:
      npm [run] test -- --watch

Testing components:
  react-test-renderer:
    Very simpler tester. Keeps a copy of the output through toMatchSnapshot() to be tested later against.
    It is only useful for very simple components, like headers, etc.
  enzyme:
    Much more complex library than the above. It needs 2 additional libraries:
      enzyme-adapter-react-16:
        This tells to enzyme that we are using react 16.
      raf:
        Short for request animation frame. It's a polyfill for the browser so things don't break.
    When working with the 'shallow' functionality, it stores a lot of "gunk" in the snapshots. In order to reduce the output it needs 'enzyme-to-json'.
      enzyme-to-json: It reduces the output of the snapshot to what we need, without enzyme "gunk" in it.

jest.config.json:
  File used by react to do some setup that runs before the tests are executed.
  The 'setupFiles' attribute admits an array of paths of files to be loaded before tests run.
  It also needs a change to the script command in package.json so it knows where the config is.
